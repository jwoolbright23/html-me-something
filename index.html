                <h2>Breckenridge, Colorado</h2>
                <p>Breckenridge, Colorado was the first vacation that the two of us went on together. On our way to the Breckenridge
                        we stopped at Mount Evans and hiked our way to the top. The peak is an astonishing 14,271 feet high making it the 
                        highest summit of the Chicago Peaks.

                <h2>Norfolk, Virginia</h2>
                <p>Norfolk, Virginia was the second trip we went on in 2017. We stayed in Gent and spent a lot of time at Virginia beach while also 
                    visiting my girlfriend's graduate school Eastern Virginia Medical School. We also took a tour of the Norfolk Naval Base which 
                    is the largest Naval base in the world.

                <h2>Manhattan, New York</h2>
                <p>Manhattan, New York was the third trip we took in 2017. We stayed in downtown Manhattan at the Intercontinental on Lexington Avenue.
                        On our first night we went to the top of the Empire State building, walked through Time's Square and visited Rockefeller Plaza.
                    Aside from that we also went to Little Italy, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the 9/11 Memorial, and also Central Park.
